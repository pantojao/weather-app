This Current Weather App was my first attempt at fetching data from an API. In this application, the user can access the current weather for almost any city by simply typing the city into the input and searching. The client will return a dynamically rendered card that includes the conditions, the temperature, and an icon describing the conditions. 

Technologies: React, Fetch, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML
